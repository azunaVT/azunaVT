## Hi, I'm Azuna 👋

A few things that define how I work:

- 🧭 **Troubleshooting-first mindset** — even in unfamiliar systems
- ⚙️ **Intentional laziness (the good kind)** — if it’s repetitive, it gets automated
- 🧠 **Fast, self-directed learner** (I’ve been called a sponge)
- 🚀 **Ambitious**, with a long-term mindset

**Lazy by design. Curious by default.**
**Very ambitious.**

### 🧠 Coding philosophy

- Production stability and user impact come first
- Mitigate fast, stabilize the system, then investigate
- Prefer safe, reversible patches over perfect fixes under pressure
- Take the time afterwards to understand root causes and fix things properly

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧩 Personal Homelab (feenx-lab)


A self-hosted homelab used to run, automate, and experiment with real-world services.

**Why it exists**
I wanted a controlled environment to run production-like workloads at home — not demos, but systems that actually need to stay up, survive failures, and be maintained over time.

**What I focused on**
- Operating and evolving a living system, not just deploying it once
- Automating repetitive operational tasks
- Troubleshooting failures across infrastructure, networking, and services
- Making safe changes with minimal downtime

**Tech & themes**
Infrastructure · Automation · Reliability · Self-hosting · Systems

### ⚙️ SimpleSave


An open-core personal finance app focused on clarity, automation, and long-term planning.

**Why it exists**
I was tired of spreadsheets and tools that require constant manual upkeep. SimpleSave treats budgeting as a system — something that should work *for* you, not demand attention.

**What I focused on**
- Reducing user friction through automation
- Designing workflows that handle partial failures gracefully
- Integrating with external APIs safely
- Iterating quickly while keeping production stability in mind

**Tech & themes**

### 🔁 retryrr

A lightweight HTTP proxy that retries failed requests for automation-heavy media services.

**Why it exists**
Some services in my homelab stack were brittle when external requests failed. I wanted a simple, targeted way to improve reliability without modifying upstream apps.

**What I focused on**
- Quick mitigation of real production pain points
- Designing a small, composable tool that does one thing well
- Improving system reliability without overengineering

**Tech & themes**
HTTP · Tooling · Reliability · Pragmatic Engineering

## 🎮 Hobbies & Interests

I enjoy systems in all their forms, even outside of code:

- 🎮 **Gaming & streaming** — automation, progression, and long-form problem solving
- 🏆 **Achievement hunting** — optimizing paths, mastering mechanics, and finishing what I start
- 🛡 **CTFs & security challenges** — learning by breaking assumptions
- 🧙 **World & story building** — DnD, game dev, and narrative systems
- 🎲 **Board games** — strategy, cooperation, and emergent decision-making
- 🎧 **Music (especially lo‑fi)** — always on in the background; focus, flow, and atmosphere
